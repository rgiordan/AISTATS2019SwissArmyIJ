# Expository examples

In this folder, we provide a few examples of accuracy bounds for
simple models on particular datasets.  The models and bounds are simple,
and their purpose is expository.  Developing tight, useful bounds on more
complex models is something we are currently thinking about.  Hopefully
these examples will help empower others to do the same!
