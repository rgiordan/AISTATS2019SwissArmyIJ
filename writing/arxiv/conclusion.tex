We recommend consideration of the Swiss Army infinitesimal jackknife for modern
machine learning problems.  The large size of modern data both increases the
need for fast approximations and renders such approximations more accurate.
Furthermore, modern automatic differentiation renders many past practical
difficulties obsolete. By stepping back from the strict requirements of
classical statistical theory, we can see that the value of the infinitesimal
jackknife extends beyond its traditional application areas, while retaining
desirable generality in other respects.
